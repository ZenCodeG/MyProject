Create a simple browser-based Mario-style platformer game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It should include:

- A red square player that can move left and right with arrow keys
- Jumping when pressing the spacebar or up arrow
- Simple gravity and jumping physics
- Basic platform collision detection
- A few green platforms placed at different heights
- A game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- All code in a single HTML file (no external libraries)
- Use the canvas to draw the game

Make the canvas 800x400, and center it on the page with a sky-blue background.
