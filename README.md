1. Double Jump
Press jump again while in the air for a second jump
Yellow indicator appears above the player when double jump is available
Double jump is slightly weaker than the first jump for balance
2. Simple Enemies
Two red enemies that patrol back and forth on the ground
Stomp them by landing on top of them (like classic Mario!)
Getting hit by enemies resets your position
Enemies have simple eyes and movement patterns
3. Moving Platforms
Orange horizontal platform that moves left and right
Orange vertical platform that moves up and down
You can ride on these platforms while they move
Different colored texture to distinguish from static platforms
4. Particle Effects
Yellow sparkles when you jump (both first and double jump)
Brown dust particles when you land on platforms
Explosion particles when you stomp an enemy
Particles fade out over time and are affected by gravity
ï¿½ï¿½ How to Play:
Movement: Arrow keys or WASD
Jump: Spacebar, Up Arrow, or W

The game now feels much more dynamic and engaging! Try jumping around, stomping enemies, and riding the moving platforms. The particle effects make every action feel satisfying and responsive.
